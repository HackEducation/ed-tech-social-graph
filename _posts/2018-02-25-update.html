<p>I have just created a handful of new datasets, tracking the various relationships among powerful people in the education industry.</p>

<p>The new datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/edison-schools">Edison Schools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/rocketship-education">Rocketship Education</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/att/">AT&amp;T</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/comcast">Comcast</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/common-sense-media">Common Sense Media</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/harvard">Harvard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/columbia">Columbia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/whittle-communications">Whittle Communications</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have to give a presentation to the Spencer Foundation in a little over a week on how my research project is coming along, and while a lot of my focus this semester has been on book writing (that is, preparations for getting <em>Teaching Machines</em> sold to a publisher), I&#8217;m also still working on this original project idea on the &#8220;ed-tech mafia.&#8221;</p>

<p>As part of that, I&#8217;ll be attending the ASU-GSV Summit in April for the first time, and I&#8217;ll have an article coming out in the fall about how education venture capital networks operate, based on what I see there and based on all this data journalism I&#8217;ve been undertaking.</p>
