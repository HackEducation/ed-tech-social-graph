<p>The phrase &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">PayPal Mafia</a>&#8221; is used to describe the group of PayPal founders and employees who&#8217;ve gone on to be some of the most powerful players in Silicon Valley, forming additional technology companies and investment firms and becoming millionaires (and in a couple of cases, billionaires) in the process. (Members of the &#8220;PayPal Mafia&#8221; include Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, Dave McClure, and Keith Rabois.)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/518196788486864898">I&#8217;ve often wondered</a> if there&#8217;s an equivalent in education technology. That is, is there a company that&#8217;s launched the careers of more ed-tech entrepreneurs and investors, that&#8217;s become a powerful political and financial and social network for education technology people and products. The Gates Foundation? Pearson? Kaplan? Blackboard? TFA? The Princeton Review?</p>

<p>This project will trace some of the networks of investors and entrepreneurs. It will draw on the research I&#8217;m undertaking to identify <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">who&#8217;s funding ed-tech</a>. But it will connect this to <em>who&#8217;s founding</em> ed-tech as well. Networks are power. Networks spread narratives.</p>
