<p>Just as I do with my work on tracking <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">ed-tech investments</a>, I'll make all the data that powers this site (and my subsequent analysis) freely and openly available. There's not much there yet, but you will be able to find JSON files containing data about various ed-tech companies in the "data" folder <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/ed-tech-social-graph">in the GitHub repository</a> that powers this project.</p>
