<p>I&#8217;ve created a timeline for &#8220;<a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/pearson.html">The History of Pearson</a>&#8221; as part of my larger research into the political and financial networks that shape education technology.</p>

<p><a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/pearson.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-06-20-pearson2.png"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning for quite some time to write an article about how a construction company founded in Yorkshire in 1844 could go on to become the world&#8217;s largest education company. At the very least, my timeline details all the investments that the giant conglomerate has made before finally turning its focus to education.</p>

<p>The timeline is at once both too detailed and too incomplete. I&#8217;ve used <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">timeline.js</a> to build it, and the Knight Lab (maker of the tool) suggests limiting the timeline to 20 slides. Mine has almost 200.</p>

<p>Much of the data in it comes <a href="http://timeline.pearson.com/">from Pearson&#8217;s own website</a>, but its timeline stops at 2014. And it is a rather carefully constructed narrative to underscore certain elements of its business. There&#8217;s no mention of Pearson&#8217;s oil interests, for example. There&#8217;s no mention of &#8220;Pineapple-gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consider this a work-in-progress. I&#8217;ll continue to fill in the gaps with missing details. (As this project is <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/ed-tech-social-graph">powered by a GitHub repository</a>, you can always leave a message there or file an &#8220;issue&#8221; if you see something I&#8217;ve overlooked.)</p>
