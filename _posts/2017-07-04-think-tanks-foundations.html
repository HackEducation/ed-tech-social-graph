<p>As I start to pull together my research on the networks that are driving education technology narratives, I wanted to gather the think tanks whose research and advocacy helps shapes these (policy) discussions. I also wanted to list the foundations that are actively funding programs and products &#8211; and similarly shaping the stories we hear about the future of education.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t an exhaustive list of either think tanks or foundations &#8211; just the ones most active in education and technology issues and thus most likely to be cited in my work. I will be keeping this information updated (and obviously, improving upon it). (<a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/ed-tech-social-graph">You can file issues on the GitHub repository that powers this project</a> if you see any glaring mistakes or omissions.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/thinktanks.html">Think Tanks</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/foundations.html">Foundations</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Does This Matter</h3>
<br />
<p>These extra-governmental organizations have an inordinate influence on politics and policies. Part of this research project:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do foundations decide where to spend their money?</li>
<li>How do certain ideas about reform get spread?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Details</h3>
<br />
<p>The data for these organizations come primarily from their own websites, as well as <a href="http://sourcewatch.org">sourcewatch.org</a>, a project of The Center for Media and Democracy. (Finding funding data is particularly challenging as not everyone is very forthcoming about their finances.)</p>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<br />
<p>I have the data in a Google Spreadsheet, which I use to generate a YAML file. (YAML means &#8220;YAML ain&#8217;t markup language.&#8221; Aren&#8217;t programmers hilarious.) As I use Jekyll and GitHub to run my websites, YAML files help configure what gets displayed and how. YAML is a structured data format, and I am using it &#8211; rather than a database per se &#8211; in order to store data for my research projects. </p>

<p>(<a href="http://apievangelist.com">Kin</a> and I plan to write up &#8211; and perhaps record a walkthrough &#8211; more details on how all this works technically.)</p>
