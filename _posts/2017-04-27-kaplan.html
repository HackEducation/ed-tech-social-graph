<p>I&#8217;m waiting for Tressie McMillan Cottom&#8217;s analysis of the (rather shocking) <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/purdue-u-is-expected-to-buy-mega-for-profit-kaplan-u-turn-it-into-a-public-university/118020">news today</a> that Purdue University is <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/for-1-purdue-university-will-acquire-a-massive-for-profit">buying</a> Kaplan University (and supposedly turning it into <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-27-purdue-buys-for-profit-kaplan-university-for-1-to-create-new-kind-of-public-university">a public university-of-sorts</a>) before I say too much. (I&#8217;m thinking this has a lot to do with <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/12/07/trends-skills">&#8220;skills,&#8221; &#8220;the employability narrative,&#8221;</a> privatization, and prestige &#8211; but really, I&#8217;m leaving that part for Tressie.) </p>

<p>I do want to jot down some notes about the Kaplan Inc business and its network of investments, people, products, and practices. Kaplan is, after all, one of the companies that I have long thought might be a powerful &#8220;ed-tech mafia&#8221; akin to how some describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">PayPal</a> founders and early execs and their influence in the direction Silicon Valley has taken.</p>

<p><em>Note: investigating ed-tech's version of the &#8220;PayPal Mafia&#8221; is <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/31/spencer-fellow">the focus of my Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship</a>. This subdomain (<a href="http://network.hackeducation.com">network.hackeducation.com</a>) is where I'm storing some of my preliminary research.</em></p>

<h3>For-Profit Schools: Some Kaplan History</h3>
<br />
<p>Kaplan Inc is a subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company, which was formerly known as The Washington Post Company (until The Washington Post portion was sold to Jeff Bezos in 2013). The company was founded in 1938 as the Stanley H Kaplan Co. (yes, by Stanley H Kaplan) as a tutoring company that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/24/AR2009082402105.html">promised it could help students succeed on the SAT</a>; and test prep remains a major portion of the company&#8217;s business today. </p>

<p>But Purdue did not buy <em>that</em> portion. It bought Kaplan University, which was founded in 1900 as the business training chain of schools Hamilton College. Hamilton College was acquired in 1998 by Quest Education Corporation, which was acquired in turn by Kaplan Inc in 2000. This acquisition was rebranded as Kaplan University in 2007.</p>

<p>Kaplan University is just one part of the Kaplan Higher and Professional Education subsidiary, as Kaplan Inc has bought many, many for-profit schools and training programs. In 2000, it acquired the American Institute of Commerce, for example, another business training college (this one founded in 1937); these were rebranded as Kaplan College. (It <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/02/13/education-corp-buys-38-kaplan-college-campuses">sold</a> 38 Kaplan College campuses to Education Corporation of America, another for-profit university company in 2015). In 2005, Kaplan acquired Asia Pacific Management Institute, a for-profit headquartered in Singapore &#8211; now rebranded to Kaplan Singapore. It acquired Aspect Education, now Kaplan International English, in 2006; this company offers English-language learning courses in the UK. In 2006, it also acquired Tribeca Learning, which offers financial and real estate services training in Australia. In 2014, Kaplan <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2014-06-25-dev-bootcamp-no-longer-bootstrapped-acquired-by-kaplan">acquired</a> Dev Bootcamp, the modern equivalent of those early twentieth-century career colleges: <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/11/23/bootcamps-the-new-for-profit-higher-ed">the coding bootcamp</a>.</p>

<h3>The Kaplan Social Graph</h3>
<br />
<p>If you look at that list of investments, you can begin to see that there&#8217;s a powerful network of influential players in education technology who are connected to Kaplan Inc money. Powerful people and powerful companies.</p>

<h3>Kaplan Inc, "New University," and the Future of For-Profit Education</h3>
<br />

<p>No really. I am waiting for Tressie's response to the news as I know it'll be the best analysis. What I see in this collection of products, practices, people, politics is a particular future that many in the ed-tech world are pushing for (through funding, through narratives, through policy):</p>

<p>Test prep. Data mining and analytics. Online education. Charter school chains. College chains. Higher ed as career colleges. Coding bootcamps. Credentialing.</p>
